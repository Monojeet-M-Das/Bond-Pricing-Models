# Bond-Pricing-Models

This repository contains Python implementations of fundamental bond pricing models using both **discrete** and **continuous** compounding. These are useful in understanding the time value of money, bond valuation, and fixed income fundamentals.

  `discrete_CouponBond_discounting.py`  
  Calculates the present value of a coupon bond using discrete compounding.

  `discrete_ZeroCouponBond_discounting.py`  
  Calculates the price of a zero-coupon bond using discrete discounting.

### 2. Continuous Discounting

  `continuous_CouponBond_discounting.py`  
  Uses continuous compounding to evaluate the present value of a coupon-paying bond.

  `continuous_ZeroCouponBond_discounting.py`  
  Implements continuous discounting for a zero-coupon bond.

## 🔢 Inputs Used in Examples
